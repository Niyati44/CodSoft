# Introduction
Welcome to my CodSoft Internship repository. This repository contains all the tasks and projects completed as part of my internship with CodSoft from June 10, 2024, to July 10, 2024.

# Task List
 Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
  Description: 
  Using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings, this model is built to classify the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines are employed to achieve this.
  
 Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
  Description: 
  This project involves building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests are used to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
  
 Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
  Description: 
  This model predicts customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Using historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and demographics, algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting are applied to forecast churn.
  
 Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
  Description: This AI model classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines are utilized to identify spam messages.

# Acknowledgements
